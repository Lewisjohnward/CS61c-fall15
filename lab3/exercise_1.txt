.data: Anything that follows is placed in the data segment (i.e. Where static data stored in memory exists)

.global: The specified label is made visible to other files (Each executable unit must have the label main declared and made externally-visible)

.word: The value of each operand is stored in a 32-bit word in memory & the words are aligned on word boundaries

.half: The value of each operand is stored in a 16-bit halfword in memory, they are aligned on halfword boundaries

2. How do you set a breakpoint in MARS

----

3. Once at a breakpoint, how do you continue to execute your code?

----

Continue stepping through code by pressing F7 otherwise continue to next breakpoint/finish program using F5
